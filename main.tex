% Uncomment this code if you want to insert a photo. 
% But inserting a photo is not recommended by default, as it is not the focus of the resume.
% If the default photo insertion format doesn't meet your needs, you can try resizing the photo or using another method of inserting the photo.
% Otherwise, you can also render the PDF resume and then use other tools to overlay photos on the PDF.
